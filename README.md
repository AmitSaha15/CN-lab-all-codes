# Questions

1.	Write a C program to implement a simple client server application using Unix file socket. The client will send a 4-digit decimal number to the server. The server will check whether it is odd or even number and send the result to the client.
2.	Write a C program to take a IPV4 address (x.x.x.x) as input. In output show whether it is a valid or invalid IP address.
3.	Create a multiclient TCP server. The client will take a name from the user & send it to the to the server. The server will check how many characters are there & send it back to the client.
4.	Write a C program to take data word & divisor from the user and get a CRC Code as the output.

5.	Write a C program to implement a simple client server application using Unix file socket. The client will take a bit stream from the user & send it to the server. The server will add a parity bit (only odd parity) and the modified bit stream to the corresponding client.
6.	 Take a decimal number from the user.  Add (10)10, (20)10     with that number and send those values to massage queue. Write two separate programs to read & display the final output from the massage queue distinctively.
7.	 Write a C program to take a bit stream from the user, implement bit stuffing and print the output of stuffed data word.
8.	 Write a C program to implement TCP socket. The client will take the roll number of six students from the user and send it to the server. The server will sort the roll numbers in ascending order and send the stream back to the client. The server & client both will print it.
9.	Take a IPV4 address as input. Write a C program to check the class it belongs.
10.	Write a client server program using UDP socket. The client will take a bit stream from the user and send it to the server. The user and send it to the server. The server will add a parity bit (only even parity) and send the modified bit stream to the corresponding client.
